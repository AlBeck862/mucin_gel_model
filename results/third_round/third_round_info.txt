Lattice units: 10^-2 um scaling
walks A-E: 300s (3000 time points)
walks F-M: 500s (5000 time points)
hist_walksF-M: histogram for walks F through M (plus two other walks not saved)

Notes:
- Walks L and M display a graphical glitch as a result of not clearing excess zeros in the matrix which stores walk data for walks that ended with a boundary immobilization. This glitch was purely graphical and did not affect the corresponding histogram. The glitch has since been fixed.
