Lattice units: 10^-2 um scaling
Number of walks: 10
Time points (each particle): 5000
Random start locations: yes
histogram_1dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 1*delta-t
histogram_5dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 5*delta-t
histogram_10dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 10*delta-t
histogram_50dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 50*delta-t
histogram_100dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 100*delta-t
msd_dt: squared displacement versus absolute time curves + MSD(dt) curve
msd_dtau: squared displacement versus lag time curves + time-averaged MSD(dtau) curve

Note: the only differences between the eleventh and twelfth round simulations is the normalization of the histograms, which was changed from "probability" to "pdf", and the MSD(dtau) averaging method, which included the trajectories of particles which hit the lattice boundary.
