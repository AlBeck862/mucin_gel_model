Random start locations: yes
histogram_1dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 1*delta-t
histogram_5dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 5*delta-t
histogram_10dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 10*delta-t
histogram_50dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 50*delta-t
histogram_100dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 100*delta-t
msd_dt: squared displacement versus absolute time curves + MSD(dt) curve
msd_dtau: squared displacement versus lag time curves + time-averaged MSD(dtau) curve

Note: this simulation was conducted on a constant-diffusivity lattice
Note: the histogram data was not filtered for extra zero-displacements
Note: the histograms in the "comparison_corrected" folder represent the same data plotted after filtering for extra zero-displacements
