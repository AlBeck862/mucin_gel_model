Lattice units: 10^-2 um scaling
Lattice parameters: grayscale image of a real mucin gel
Number of walks: 100
Time points (each particle): 5000
Random start locations: yes

msd_dt: squared displacement versus absolute time curves + MSD(dt) curve
msd_dtau: squared displacement versus lag time curves + time-averaged MSD(dtau) curve + lines of best fit plotted on a log-log graph + error bars representing the standard deviations at certain sample points along the time-averaged MSD(dtau) curve

histograms: normalized histograms of displacements in the x-direction and the y-direction for various multiples of delta-t (note: all histogram fits are Gaussian)
step_sizes: folder of step-size plots for individual particles
diffusivities: folder of bar plots of the frequency of each unique diffusivity encountered by individual particles
heatmaps: heatmaps of the diffusivities encountered by all particles (maximum of 25 particles displayed per heatmap)

**PARTICLES HAD A 1/3 CHANCE OF NOT MOVING AT A GIVEN TIME POINT
