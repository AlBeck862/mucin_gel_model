Lattice units: 10^-2 um scaling
Number of walks: 5
Time points (each particle): 5000
Random start locations: yes
histogram_1dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 1*delta-t
histogram_5dt_dx: normalized histogram of x-direction displacements for 5*delta-t
histogram_5dt_dy: normalized histogram of y-direction displacements for 5*delta-t
histogram_10dt_dx: normalized histogram of x-direction displacements for 10*delta-t
histogram_10dt_dy: normalized histogram of y-direction displacements for 10*delta-t
histogram_50dt_x: normalized histogram of x-direction displacements for 50*delta-t
histogram_50dt_y: normalized histogram of y-direction displacements for 50*delta-t
histogram_100dt_x: normalized histogram of x-direction displacements for 100*delta-t
histogram_100dt_y: normalized histogram of y-direction displacements for 100*delta-t
msd_dt: squared displacement versus absolute time curves + MSD(dt) curve
msd_dtau: squared displacement versus lag time curves + time-averaged MSD(dtau) curve

Note: all walks used the corrected displacement-selection method
Note: all histograms were generated using the new histogram plotting method
Note: the spike around the origin in histogram_5dt_dx and histogram_5dt_dy is the result of the data processing method used to generate the histograms and is documented in the project's research notes (May 26, 2021)
