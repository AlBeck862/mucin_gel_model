msd_dt: squared displacement versus absolute time curves + MSD(dt) curve
msd_dtau: squared displacement versus lag time curves + time-averaged MSD(dtau) curve

Note: this was the first use of the new simulation method which uses simultaneous x-direction displacements and y-direction displacements at each particle "jump"
