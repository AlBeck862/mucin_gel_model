Lattice units: 10^-2 um scaling
Number of walks: 10
Time points (each particle): 5000

Walk Samples A & B: two sample walks of the 10 that were simulated
histogram_1dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 1*delta-t
histogram_2dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 2*delta-t
histogram_3dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 3*delta-t
histogram_4dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 4*delta-t
histogram_5dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 5*delta-t
histogram_10dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 10*delta-t
histogram_50dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 50*delta-t
histogram_100dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 100*delta-t
histogram_125dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 125*delta-t
histogram_150dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 150*delta-t
histogram_175dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 175*delta-t
histogram_200dt: normalized histogram of displacements for 200*delta-t
msd_dt: squared displacement versus absolute time curves + MSD(dt) curve
msd_dtau: squared displacement versus lag time curves + time-averaged MSD(dtau) curve

Note: the walk was simulated in one dimension only (in the x-direction).
